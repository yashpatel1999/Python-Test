13. **b. The mutation will increase the frequency of replication errors due to impaired proofreading.**  
14. **a. DNA strands would not separate due to unrelieved supercoiling ahead of the replication fork.**  
15. **b. Errors would accumulate in the DNA because damaged sections could not be replaced.**
