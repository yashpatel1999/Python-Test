## Part-2

1. **Frequency Table, Mean, Variance, and Standard Deviation Calculation**  
   Using the grouped data set representing the number of hours students study per week:  

   | Hours Studied | Frequency |
   |---------------|----------|
   | 0-5           | 3        |
   | 6-10          | 7        |
   | 11-15         | 10       |
   | 16-20         | 5        |

   1. Construct a frequency table.
   2. Calculate the mean, variance, and standard deviation of the study hours based on the frequency distribution.

   Using the following data set representing the ages of a group of participants:  
   \[22, 25, 28, 30, 22, 24, 26, 30, 32, 29\]  
   Construct a box-and-whisker plot using the five-number summary (minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, maximum). Include the values of the five-number summary in your answer.

3. **Sets, Permutations, and Probability Calculation**  

   1. **Permutations**:  
      - Determine how many different ways the letters of the word "BOOK" can be arranged (consider the repeating letter).

   2. **Probability Calculation**:  
      - A box contains 5 red balls, 3 blue balls, and 2 green balls. If one ball is drawn at random, calculate the probability that the ball drawn is blue or red.

4. **A factory produces two types of products: A and B. Product A accounts for 70% of the total production, while Product B accounts for 30%. The defect rate for Product A is 5%, and for Product B, it is 10%. If a randomly selected product is found to be defective, calculate the probability that it is Product A using Bayes’ theorem.**

5. **A factory produces light bulbs, and 90% of them pass the quality control test. If 10 bulbs are randomly selected, calculate the probability that exactly 8 of them pass the quality control test. Provide the numerical value of your answer.**
