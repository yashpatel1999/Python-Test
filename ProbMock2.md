### Problem 1:
The following table presents the distribution of grades obtained by all 250 students (population) who took the Mat-XYZ exam in the spring of 2023.

| Grades \(x_i\) | \(n_i\) | \(f_i\) | \(F_i\) |
|----------------|---------|---------|---------|
| [0, 20]        | 15      |         |         |
| ]20, 40]       | 35      |         |         |
| ]40, 60]       | 75      |         |         |
| ]60, 80]       | 90      |         |         |
| ]80, 100]      | 35      |         |         |

#### Tasks:
(a) Complete the table by finding the relative and cumulative relative frequencies.

(b) Find the approximate mean and median grades.

(c) Explain the differences between your results in (b).

(d) Find the approximate standard deviation of the grades.

(e) Estimate the **75th percentile** of the grade distribution.

Hereâ€™s a similar problem modeled after the example you provided:

### Problem 2:

**James and Emma are conducting an experiment to study the effects of a new dietary supplement on improving cognitive performance in rabbits.** The supplement is expected to enhance problem-solving skills. The experiment is conducted as follows: each rabbit is presented with a maze containing a treat at the end. The time it takes for the rabbit to solve the maze is recorded. The experiment is repeated, and results from the first and second trials are compared. 

The supplement is deemed effective if the time taken on the second trial is at least 20% less than the first trial. Two groups of rabbits were tested: one received the supplement, and the other did not.

In their research, James and Emma tested 200 rabbits that received the supplement, and 140 demonstrated significant improvement. Assume the probability \(p\) of improvement due to the supplement is constant and equal for all rabbits (tested independently).

### Tasks:
(a) Based on the experimental data, calculate \(p\). Scientists from Greenhill University want to validate this result by testing the supplement on a new group of 30 rabbits. 

(b) Find the expected value and standard deviation of the number of rabbits in the new group that will show improvement due to the supplement.

(c) Assuming \(p\) is accurate, calculate the probability that at least 25 rabbits in the new group show significant improvement.

### Problem 3:

A prestigious private event hall has seating for 35 guests. Reservations are mandatory, and attendees are expected to adhere to a formal dress code. It is known that 15% of reservations are either canceled or result in no-shows. You may assume that all reservations are independent.

Let \( N \) represent the variable: **number of guests who actually show up at the event**.

### Tasks:
(a) If exactly 35 people made reservations, what is the probability that fewer than 35 of them show up?

(b) How many reservations should the hall accept to ensure the **expected number of attendees** equals 35?

(c) Using the number of reservations found in (b), recalculate the probability that fewer than 35 people show up.
