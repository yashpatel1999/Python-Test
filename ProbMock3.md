### **Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs)**

#### 1.  
The following data represents the scores of 10 students on a math quiz:  
\[ 5, 7, 8, 8, 10, 10, 10, 12, 15, 20 \]  
What is the mode of the data?  
- a) 8  
- b) 10  
- c) 15  
- d) 20  

---

#### 2.
A histogram of a dataset shows a peak on the left-hand side and a long tail on the right. How would you describe the shape of the distribution?  
- a) Symmetric  
- b) Uniform  
- c) Skewed to the right  
- d) Skewed to the left  

---

#### 3.  
If the probability of event \( A \) occurring is 0.65, what is the probability of \( A' \) (the complement of \( A \))?  
- a) 0.35  
- b) 0.5  
- c) 0.75  
- d) 1.0  



#### 4.
In a survey of 100 people, 60 like tea, 40 like coffee, and 20 like both. What is the probability that a person likes tea given that they like coffee?  
- a) 0.2  
- b) 0.3  
- c) 0.5  
- d) 0.6  

---

#### 5. **Concept: Z-Score and Normal Distribution**  
For a normally distributed dataset, the mean is 100 and the standard deviation is 15. What is the z-score of a value 130?  
- a) 2  
- b) -2  
- c) 3  
- d) -3  

---

### **True/False Questions**

#### 6. **Concept: Independence of Events**  
If two events \( A \) and \( B \) are independent, then \( P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B) \).  

---

#### 7. **Concept: Empirical Rule**  
According to the empirical rule, approximately 68% of data in a normal distribution falls within one standard deviation of the mean.  

---

#### 8. **Concept: Confidence Intervals**  
A 95% confidence interval means there is a 95% probability that the population parameter lies within the interval.  


---

#### 9. **Concept: Hypothesis Testing Errors**  
A Type II error occurs when a true null hypothesis is rejected.  

---

#### 10. **Concept: Chi-Square Test**  
The chi-square test is used to determine the relationship between two categorical variables.
