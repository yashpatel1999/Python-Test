### **Statistics Questions:**
1. A researcher measures the test scores of students from two classes. Class A has a mean score of 75, while Class B has a median score of 78. The researcher wants to compare the central tendencies of these groups.  
   **Question:** Which statistical concept is relevant here?  

2. A company analyzes the heights of its employees and finds that the data has a variance of 9 cm². They want to compute the standard deviation to better understand the spread.  
   **Question:** What concept should the company use to find the spread of data?  

3. A study shows that as the number of hours worked per week increases, job satisfaction decreases. The researcher wants to quantify the strength and direction of this relationship.  
   **Question:** Which concept will help the researcher?  

4. A scientist is studying the average weight of cats in a city. To estimate this, they take a sample of 50 cats from various areas.  
   **Question:** Which statistical concept justifies using the sample to represent the population?  


5. A box contains 5 red balls and 5 blue balls. Two balls are drawn randomly without replacement. The probability of the second ball being red depends on the first ball drawn.  
   **Question:** What concept explains this dependency?  

6. A team flips a coin 10 times and records the number of heads. They repeat this experiment 100 times to study the distribution of the results.  
   **Question:** Which probability concept applies to this situation?  

7. In a game, a player rolls a fair 6-sided die and wins $5 for rolling a 6 and $1 for rolling any other number. The player wants to determine the average winnings per roll.  
   **Question:** What concept helps calculate the average winnings?  

8. A factory tracks the number of defective items produced each day. Over time, the average proportion of defective items approaches 5%.  
   **Question:** Which concept describes this behavior?  

9. A card is drawn at random from a standard deck of 52 cards. The probability of drawing a red card is asked.  
   **Question:** Which theory applies to solve this?  

10. **Example:**  
   A survey records the number of students in each class at a university. Another survey measures the height of students in centimeters.  
   **Question:** Which concept helps differentiate between these two types of variables?  
  
11. **Example:**  
   The average height of a certain species of plant is normally distributed with a mean of 50 cm and a standard deviation of 5 cm. A botanist combines the measurements from two independent samples of plants to find their total height.  
   **Question:** What distribution applies to the sum of these measurements?  

12. **Example:**  
   A researcher takes multiple random samples of 100 individuals from a population and computes the mean income for each sample. As the sample size increases, the researcher notices that the distribution of sample means approaches a normal shape.  
   **Question:** What statistical concept explains this behavior?  

13. **Example:**  
   A political poll estimates that 60% of voters support a candidate, with a margin of error of ±3% at a 95% confidence level.  
   **Question:** Which concept explains the range and confidence level of this estimate?  
 
14. **Example:**  
   A scientist tests whether a new drug is more effective than an existing drug. They calculate a p-value of 0.03 and compare it to a significance level of 0.05.  
   **Question:** Which concept helps determine if the null hypothesis should be rejected?  

15. **Example:**  
   A study examines the relationship between hours studied and exam scores for students. The researcher wants to predict a student's score based on their study hours.  
   **Question:** Which concept should be used to model this relationship?  

16. **Example:**  
   A marketing team wants to test whether customer preferences for three products are equally distributed. They collect survey data and compare the observed frequencies with expected frequencies.  
   **Question:** Which statistical test is appropriate for this analysis?
